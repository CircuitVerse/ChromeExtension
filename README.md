## About the project
The project is an extension that allows the user to embed CircuitVerse circuit's in a Google Slide. Unfortunately, Google Slides does not embed iframe. However, it is possible to achieve that by using a combination of Google Slides Add-On on and chrome extension.
### CircuitVerse
[CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org) is a product developed by students at IIIT-Bangalore. It aims to provide a platform where circuits can be designed and simulated using a graphical user interface. While users can design complete CPU implementations within the simulator, the software is designed primarily for educational use. CircuitVerse is an opensource project with an active community.
